# Simple BUJO
Simple BUJO is a cloud-based application that seeks to transfer the principle of Bullet Journal (BUJO) from paper form to a mobile and web application.

I am motivated by many years of using this system to create notes and tasks, but I am often somewhere without my notebook and have to create notes later. This app allows me to use Bullet Journal everywhere without limitations.

## How application works
Client applications connect to the cloud backend and send any changes directly to the cloud. This ensures near-real-time synchronization of notes across devices.

## Application state
The application is in the design and prototyping phase.
